python-finance/tda-bot - This is where all the good stuff is - bots for automated trading using a variety of indicators, and backtesting tools.

Other stuff:
python-finance/interactivebrokers - Tools and scripts for downloading and archiving short availability from Interactive Brokers.
python-finance/python-pypfopt - Test tools using python-pypfopt module for portfolio balancing.
python-finance/rh-bot - Just a test to see how to use the RobinHood API. Nothing here yet.
