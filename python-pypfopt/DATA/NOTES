check-ticker.sh uses pfopt-check-history.py. It will iterate over all the
.csv files and check that the first ticker in the file has a history that
starts on 2013-01-01. If not it will print the name of the file and the
ticker name.

This is needed to ensure data is properly downloaded in later scripts. The
yahoo datareader has some bug that requires that the first ticker has history
that covers the entire requested range for all stocks.

To get around this I'll just add some default ticker to the top of each of
these files, i.e.:

A,Agilent Technologies Inc. Common Stock,$127.98,1.02,0.803%,39083729269.00,United States,1999,1257875,Capital Goods,Biotechnology: Laboratory Analytical Instruments
